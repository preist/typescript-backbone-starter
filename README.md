# typescript-backbone-starter
A boilerplate writing Backbone.js in TypeScript and compiling it with webpack

## Description
An unsophisticated starter project meant to make it easier to get started with writing Backbone.js projects in TypeScript. This is a work in progress.

## Getting started
Before you can start writing code you need to install all the dependencies. You need to have [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/) and [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (or [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/)) properly installed on your system. Use `npm` or `yarn` to install dependencies.

```bash
$ npm install
```

#### To start a development server
To run a local server and run your project in a browser window run:

```bash
$ npm run start
```

This will start a local server that you can open in your browser by pointing it to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000). The browser will refresh every time you save your source files.

#### To build a production version of your code
To build a compressed production ready version of your source code you can run the following command:

```bash
$ npm run production
```

This will generate `*.bundle.js` files inside your `dist` directory.
